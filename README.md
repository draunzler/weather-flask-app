# weatherio-flask-app

## Overview
==Weatherio== is a weather web-app where you search for any city around the world
and it fetches the weather details for you. It also shows the current time
of the city.

## Instructions
Download the code and run it on any IDE.

You CANNOT just open a live server using the `index.html` as
Flask is a server-sided framework and hence it needs to be 
running on a server in order to process requests and generate responses.

So unless you have the flask app hosted in a server-hosting service like
Heroku, run the python file and use the locally hosted URL.

Before running the code, make sure you have `Flask` installed.
If not installed, install it follow the steps:
- open the terminal of the IDE
- go to the directory where `pip` is installed
- install the `Flask` package by running the command `pip install Flask`

After running the code, you'll find a url link in the terminal where it
is locally hosted. Usually the URL is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Use that
link and run the app
